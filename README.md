        N4 Beach in Kasimedu offers respite from fast-paced Chennai city life, with its multi-coloured boats and relaxed vibe.At eight in the morning, when the city has woken up from its slumber, a lone, ignored coastal spot in North Chennai, near Kasimedu fishing harbour, begins to stretch and yawn.The cacophony of vehicles gives way to quietude as you enter this fishing harbour, a less glamorous neighbour of popular Kasimedu harbour, teeming with fish vendors. This port is more of a dock for all the boats.
